"bash" is the programming language of the terminal.
To start out, you can think of the terminal as an application
similar to your file browser. When you launch the terminal,
the current directory is your home directory. Here are a list
of basic bash commands you can type into the terminal

ls: lists the contents of the current working directory
pwd: print working directory. Shows the path of your current directory
cd <directory name>: change directory to the directory name passed in
cd ..: go up a directory
mkdir <directory name>: make a directory in your current working directory
touch <file name>: make a file in your current working directory
