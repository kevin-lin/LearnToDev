Here are the steps you need to take in order to push your program
to github.

1) In the terminal, navigate to your project's directory.
2) "git status" will show you a list of files that have been changed
   since the last commit
3) "git add --all" will stage all files in your project for commit
4) "git commit -m "write a message here"" will commit the changes you
   have made to the project
5) "git push" will push your latest commit to github.

so when you are ready to commit your changes, type the following commands
into your terminal:
git status
git add --all
git status
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
git push
