Just as there are many different spoken languages such as English,
Mandarin, Spanish, etc., There are many different programming languages.
In general, each programming language has a different primary use.
Here are a couple of popular programming languages you might have heard
of: C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Javascript. In this course, I am going
to focus on teaching Javascript. Note that although the name is similar
to Java, it is a completely different programming language. Javascript
is the language of the web. You will be using Javascript to create
websites. so lets get started.

First you are going to need to download and install a couple of programs.
Download and install Google Chrome, Sublime Text, and NodeJS. You can
search for these programs through google.

Sublime Text is the text editor we will be using to write code.

We will be using NodeJS as a Javascript interpreter to run our
Javascript programs.
